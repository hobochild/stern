# Stern

> strict and severe; using extreme measures or terms.

Stern is in inspired by Jess's collection of dockerfiles for running binaries on servers and desktops. Dockerfiles work great for containerizing applications but when running CLI's it's often more trouble than it's worth and so you end up running unisolated programs on your host filesystem. Stern is a collection of Binary docker-compose files and a client to make it easy to run binaries safely.
